        <span> Hi, I am a Frontend Deverloper based in Gie√üen, Germany. In the last months I have found my passion for coding and building software. 
            After finishing an expansive Coding School for Frontend Developers, I want to prove myself to the working world and I hope to become a part of your team to build interesting software.

            <p>I grew up in middle Germany and graduated from highschool in 2021 with GPA of 1.2(A) and also got 
                the Abiturprice for mathematics by the German Mathematical Society. I am a fast learner and absolutely fascinated by software, so I would love to be part of your Softwaredevelopmentteam.</p>

            <p>After my graduation from highschool I wasn't sure what I want to become in life, so I took a gap-year.
            During that time I traveled through Europe, volunteered for a company cooking and helping homeless people in lisbon and also worked in a fabric. 
            I decided to start studying mathematics in September 2022, but shortly after I realized, that coding and building software is my passion. I started coding with Java and shortly after used it especially in Android Studio and build simple apps.
            In November 2022 I started the Developerakademie Codingschool and learned Webdevelopment with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Angular and I just became even more passionate about coding!</p>
