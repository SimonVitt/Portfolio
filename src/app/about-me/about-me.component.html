        <h2>About me</h2>
        <span> Hi, I am a Fullstack Deverloper based in Gie√üen, Germany. I work for the Developerakademie as a Softwaredeveloper and Softwaredeveloper-Mentor. We teach and develop in the Frontend with HTML, CSS, JS and Angular.
            In the Backendcourse I teach Django (mostly DRF) and also deployment to Google Cloud. For the company I also write Software with Flask.

            <p>I grew up in middle Germany and graduated from high school in 2021 with a GPA of 1.2. Also I got
                the Abiturprice for mathematics by the German Mathematical Society. I am a fast learner and absolutely
                fascinated by software.</p>

            <p>I took a gap-year after my graduation from highschool.
                During that time I traveled through Europe. I volunteered for a company helping homeless people in Lisbon
                and also worked in a fabric.
                Then I decided to start studying mathematics in September 2022. I shortly after realized, that coding and
                building software is my passion. So I started working at the Developerakademie as a softwaredeveloper and mentor.
                I became even more passionate in coding, especially about Angular, Flask and Django.</p>
